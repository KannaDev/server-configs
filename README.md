# What even is this?
This is mainly a public repo to be used internally for my server related configs and scripts (if i remember to push them to here)

If you'd like to use these, go ahead. They have no license as there's no point for them to. Though, these are mainly tailored to my setup...
## proxmox-cloudinit/base.yaml
This is my base .yaml for my cloudinit's. It's attached to the VM's under vendor, and if you'd like to deploy a similar version you can [here](https://blog.kannadev.com/posts/tailscale-proxmox/).
